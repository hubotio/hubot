# While all other files have been converted to JavaScript via https://github.com/github/hubot/pull/1347,
# we left the `bin/hubot` file to remain in CoffeeScript in order prevent
# breaking existing 3rd party adapters of which some are still written in
# CoffeeScript themselves. We will depracate and eventually remove this file
# in a future version of hubot
