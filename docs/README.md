# Hubot

## Getting Started With Hubot

You will need [node.js](nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). Joyent has
an [excellent blog post on how to those installed](http://joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm), so we'll omit detailing that here for right now.

Once node and npm are ready, we can install hubot and coffeescript:

    % npm install -g hubot coffee-script
    
This will give us the `hubot` script, which is used for running a hubot, but
more importantly to start, generating your own hubot. The name of the new bot is
the last argument, and will be created in the directory of the same name. For
example, to create a new bot named myhubot:

    % hubot --create myhubot

If you are using git, the generated bot includes a .gitignore, so you can
initialize and add everything:

    % cd bender
    % git init
    % git add .
    % git commit -m "Initial commit"

You have have your own runnable instance of hubot! There's a `bin/hubot`
command for convenience, to handle installing npm dependencies, loading scripts,
and then launching your hubot.

    % bin/hubot
    Hubot>

This has loaded hubot using the [shell adapter](docs/adapters/shell.md), which
is very useful for development. Note the `Hubot>` though. This is the name he'll
`respond` to with commands. For example, to list available commands:

    % bin/hubot
    Hubot> hubot: help
    hubot <keyword> tweet - Returns a link to a tweet about <keyword>
    hubot <user> is a badass guitarist - assign a role to a user
    hubot <user> is not a badass guitarist - remove a role from a user
    hubot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few parameters to try to return an animated GIF instead.
    hubot convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.
    hubot die - End hubot process
    hubot echo <text> - Reply back with <text>
    hubot fake event <event> - Triggers the <event> event for debugging reasons
    hubot help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.
    hubot help <query> - Displays all help commands that match <query>.
    hubot image me <query> - The Original. Queries Google Images for <query> and returns a random top result.
    hubot map me <query> - Returns a map view of the area returned by `query`.
    hubot math me <expression> - Calculate the given expression.
    hubot mustache me <query> - Searches Google Images for the specified query and mustaches it.
    hubot mustache me <url> - Adds a mustache to the specified URL.
    hubot ping - Reply with pong
    hubot show storage - Display the contents that are persisted in the brain
    hubot show users - Display all users that hubot knows about
    hubot the rules - Make sure hubot still knows the rules.
    hubot time - Reply with current time
    hubot translate me <phrase> - Searches for a translation for the <phrase> and then prints that bad boy out.
    hubot translate me from <source> into <target> <phrase> - Translates <phrase> from <source> into <target>. Both <source> and <target> are optional
    hubot who is <user> - see what roles a user has
    hubot youtube me <query> - Searches YouTube for the query and returns the video embed link.
    pug bomb N - get N pugs
    pug me - Receive a pug
    ship it - Display a motivation squirrel

You almost definitely will want to change his name. bin/hubot takes a `--name`
option towards this end:

    % bin/hubot --name myhubot
    myhubot> 

Now your hubot will respond to `myhobot`. It's worth noting that this is
case-insensitive, and that you can prefix with `@` or suffix with `:`. That
means these are equivalent:

    MYHUBOT help
    myhubot help
    @myhubot help
    myhubot: help

### Deploying

You can deploy hubot to Heroku, which is the officially supported method.
Additionally you are able to deploy hubot to a UNIX-like system or Windows.
Please note the support for deploying to Windows isn't officially supported.
