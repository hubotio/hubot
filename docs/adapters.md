# Adapters

Adapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on.

Hubot includes two official adapters:

* [Shell](./adapters/shell.html), i.e. for use with development
* [Campfire](./adapters/campfire.html)

There are Third-party adapters available for most chat services. Here are the most popular ones:

* [Discord](https://github.com/hubot-friends/hubot-discord)
* [IRC](https://github.com/hubot-friends/hubot-irc)
* [Slack](https://github.com/hubot-friends/hubot-slack)
* [MS Teams](https://github.com/hubot-friends/hubot-ms-teams)
* [Gitter](https://github.com/huafu/hubot-gitter2)
* [HipChat](https://github.com/hipchat/hubot-hipchat)
* [Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat)
