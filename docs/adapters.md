# Adapters

Adapters are the interface to the service you want your 'botforge' to run on.

Botforge includes two official adapters:

* [Shell](./adapters/shell.md), i.e. for use with development
* [Campfire](./adapters/campfire.md)

There are Third-party adapters available for most chat services. Here are the most popular ones:

* [Gitter](https://github.com/huafu/hubot-gitter2)
* [HipChat](https://github.com/hipchat/hubot-hipchat)
* [IRC](https://github.com/nandub/hubot-irc)
* [Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat)
* [Slack](https://github.com/slackhq/hubot-slack)
* [XMPP](https://github.com/markstory/hubot-xmpp)
