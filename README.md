# Mebot

Mebot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot].

This project is a tying together of a yo generated hubot and several published packages for the purpose of taking an individual's presence in one room and replicating this onto a different service.

It was written by Andrew Lucas for resin.io's internal communication streamlining.
