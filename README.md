# Ultra-Hubot

Originally Hubot is a chat bot, modeled after GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty
cool. He's [extendable with scripts](http://hubot.github.com/docs/#scripts) and can work on [many
different chat services](https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/).

What we wish to achieve with this fork of hubot is to add a few more features.

Ability to query various other virtual assitants or to be called by other virtual assitance.

The ability to have a phone number and when called it will recieve your calls and either confirm that the tasks assigned to it were completed are done.

The ability to recognise faces when given a picture and then query your facebook and give you a report about who you are seeing.

The ability to query public or private databases for information about the people that surround you.

This repository provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you
use for building your own bots.  See the [documentation](http://hubot.github.com/docs)
for details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.

In most cases, you'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly if you
are building your own bot. But if you do, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you'd like to chat, drop by [#hubot](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#hubot) on FreeNode IRC.
